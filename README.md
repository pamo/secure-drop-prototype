# Secure Drop Prototype

Design ideas for [SecureDrop](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop).

## Compiling the CSS from the source files

This code uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). You'll need to [install it](http://sass-lang.com/install) and then watch the sass files e.g. with:

    sass -w sass/styles.scss:css/styles.css
